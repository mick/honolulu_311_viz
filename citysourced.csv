The sprinklers are still flooding the sidewalk and intersection for pedestrians. These sprinklers I'm complaining about are along the street on Kamehameha Hwy. at the Waipio Uka St. where the Central Oahu Regional Park is. The sprinklers water directly on the sidewalk and will shower pedestrians and may be dangerous to walk if the sidewalk is wet. One of my suggestions is to change the time to a much later time like 11pm or later or after the bus stops running. Please fix this soon as this can be a very dangerous situation.

This noise did not exist 4-6 months ago. If you stand on Makai 725 Kapiolani on sidewalk near the Republicant headquarters about 20 feet Diamond head of there facing the street you will hear it. Not every vehicle hits the manhole cover, but in the evening and morning hours, speeders hit it and of course it is quieter in evening late PM early AM. This noise dud not exist a few months ago, as I have been here long time. You may be able to hear it on the video, taken over 200 ft up. This is a relatively quiet area at night, except for the patrons of the restaurant on the Kapiolani Mauka late nights.

It takes hours every day to keep the property clear. Can you please send someone out there to clean that access way and notify park officials to dump leaves instead of blowing them into that alley.

There is also a second manhole cover just a few feet before it that is also missing screws allowing it to move sideways. For some reason, the original 311 report was ""Closed"" with the problem still unresolved so I am resubmitting it with additional location info. This report was originally submitted under ""Broken Sidewalk"" category but you folks redirected this to the ""Vandalized Signs"" category. Now I am resubmitting this report under ""Broken Street Lights"" category as I have further investigated and found that this electrical manhole cover is directly related to the street light next to it.
